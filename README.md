### **Navbar Redesign**

1. **Grouped Links into a Dropdown:**
   - The original navbar had 9 links, causing layout issues on tablet screens where the links and logo overlapped.
   - Grouped 5 related links (**Opportunity**, **Consulting**, **Insights**, **Innovation**, and **Biomass**) under a single dropdown menu titled **"Main Section"** for better organization and usability.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Implemented a **hamburger menu** for small screens to enhance navigation on mobile devices.
   - The hamburger menu ensures a clean and clutter-free design on smaller viewports.

3. **Interactive Hamburger Animation:**
   - Added a **toggle animation** to the hamburger menu:
     - On click, the hamburger icon rotates and transforms into a close symbol.
     - On subsequent clicks, it smoothly transitions back to the original hamburger icon.


### **Video Section Redesign**

1. **Responsive Video Design:**
   - The original video on the homepage was not responsive and caused layout issues on tablet screens.
   - Adjusted the video settings to ensure it scales properly across all devices, including tablets, without overlapping or distortion.

2. **Optimized for Different Screen Sizes:**
   - Added **responsive behavior** so that the video dynamically adapts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless viewing experience on both large and small devices.
